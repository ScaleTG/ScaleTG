ScaleTG is a Telegram bot framework designed to help deliver new bots to the platform in a fast manner.
having scalibility in mind, the roadmap of this project is currently under development.

## Getting Started
To use the ScaleTG platform, run the following commands in your desired location:

```bash
git clone depth=1 https://github.com/WiGeeky/ScaleTG
cd ScaleTG
rm -r .git && git init # This is optional, but it is reccommended that you initialize a new git repository
python3 -m venv .env
./.env/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cp config.example.py config.py
```
then edit the `config.py` file and enter the information necessary.
